This project aims to simulate a versatile MIMO spatial multiplexing system (VBLAST) and assess its performance with different precoding/receiving techniques. Key features include QPSK modulation, accommodating any number of transmit and receive antennas, and two MIMO modes: uncoded transmission and precoded transmission using Eigenvalue steering. The system operates over a Rician MIMO channel with a variable Rician factor 𝐾. Implemented receivers include combiner receiver and various options for uncoded MIMO transmission. The project requires well-documented code, a comprehensive report with results and comparisons, and evaluations under different conditions, such as varying 𝐾 and number of antennas. The project outcomes aim for a clear understanding of the simulation parameters, efficient code execution, and insightful analysis of simulation results.
